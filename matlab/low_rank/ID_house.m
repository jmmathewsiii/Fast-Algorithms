%     Constructs the vector vn with vn(1) = 1, and the scalar scal, 
%     such that the obviously self-adjoint
%     H := identity_matrix - scal * vn * adjoint(vn) is unitary,
%     the absolute value of the first entry of Hx
%     is the root-sum-square of the entries of x,
%     and all other entries of Hx are zero
%     (H is the Householder matrix corresponding to x).
%     
%     Input:
%       x -- vector to reflect into its first component
%     
%     Output:
%       css -- root-sum-square of the entries of x * the phase of x(1)
%       vn -- entries 2 to n of the Householder vector vn;
%       vn(1) is assumed to be 1
%       scal -- scalar multiplying vn * adjoint(vn);
%       
%       scal = 2/(1 + |vn(2)|^2 + ... + |vn(n)|^2) when vn(2), ..., vn(n) don't all vanish;
%       
%       scal = 0 when vn(2), ..., vn(n) do all vanish (including when n = 1)
