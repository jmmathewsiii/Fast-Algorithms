% 		This algorithm is a variation of the standard ID code which uses randomized
% 		methods to compute an interpolative decomposition, that is: 
%		
% 		  A(:,I) \approx A(:,I(1:k))*[I,T]
%		
% 		The function has two modes of operating:
%		
% 		(1) If the second input is smaller than 1, then the function
% 		    determines the rank k adaptively via randomized methods.
%		
% 		(2) If the second input is larger than of equal to 1, then it
% 		    sets k = params
%		
% 		The structure of this code is based on the iddecomp code (Martinsson,
% 		OMNI). It uses the RandQZ and double GS functions.
