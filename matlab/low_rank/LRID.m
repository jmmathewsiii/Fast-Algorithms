% 	This function writes A symmetric as low rank using the ID. 

[Tid,Jid] = ID(A,acc); k = size(Tid,1);

% U is defined as the subsampled set of columns of A. 
U = A(:,Jid(1:k));

% V' is in turn R, the right interpolation matrix, including the inverse permutation
V(Jid,:) = [eye(k) Tid].'; 

T.U = U; 
T.V = V;
